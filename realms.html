                <p>This story explores a wandering poet's childhood and relationship with her brother. 
                From street fights to druidic fire, trucking to train hopping, it is a story of strange magics.<br><br>
                I began writing this as the backstory to my graphic novel, set in an urban fantasy California. 
                But the richness of the family history and of sibling's love soon spilled out into a story much farther reaching than I expected.
                It's a story for the unheard kids, dropouts, loners, and weirdos. And who was I, if not one of those loners? <br><br>
                I'm still working on this story but it holds a really special place in my heart.

                <h2 class = "awards">The Winged Creatures</h2>
                <p>My biggest project right now, this story is deeply character driven. 
                  It centers around the goth band <i>The Winged Creatures</i> in NYC throughout the decades.
                  The drummer is Tango/Luna, a nihilist vampire who steals memories and is looking to be worshipped.
                  The singer & guitarist is Bristol, a deeply unserious punk kid who has a bad habit of slipping through time and space.
                  Lastly, the bassist is Flower-Hands, a creature grown from the woods and the trinkets of love that humans left behind.
                  To say they look at life differently would be the understatement of the century.
                  <br><br>
                  They each search to scrape their own life, ideas of god and love in each other and in the city of their music.
                  I want this story to also be a tribute to cities in general, the vast masses of humanity that gather in clubs and concerts,
                  mingling and living life in a thousand different ways.
                  This story is shaping up to be a full novel, hopefully finished in a couple of years.

                  Okay one page left.<br>
                  Are you with me here?<br>
                  It's narrative now, data now, structure now.<br>
                  The signatures are bleeding out in paper binding into the<br>
                  burning hijabs doxed on the rubble floor next to<br>
                  the white-mangled open heart,<br>
                  surgically stripped of color<br>
                  into meditative grayscale-<br>
                  _____________and back<br>
                  _______to the boxcars<br>
                  __to the lumbering beasts<br>
                  through the fields of wheat<br>
                  in their hunks of meat and machine<br>
                  all under the great sky<br>
                  of the global imaginary.<br>
                  <br>
                  Okay there's one space left for us to get it right!<br>
                  The hopeful marching - coffee houses!<br>
                  into concerts!<br>
                  into rushing the field!<br>
                  the fall of currency!<br>
                  from the illusion of consciousness!<br>
                  <br>
                  One scrap left-<br>
                  So tell me, do you see me<br>
                  (do you see a human)<br>
                  in these CVS receipts and origami cranes?<br>
                  <br>
                  Here.<br>
                  One moment left here.<br>
                  <br>
                  Listen, it's<br>
                  diagnosis: lobotomy<br>
                  prescription: fiction restriction addiction<br>
                  I on the I of the Ion<br>
                  Turning the excitement of the smallest unit<br>
                  out and away from the<br>
                  blinding sun.<br>
                  <br>
                  I sit, yes I, I and not<br>
                  not you here.<br>
                  I I I sit on the tidy-mess<br>
                  and grab little wooden blocks<br>
                  of words together.<br>
                  <br>
                  Their Legos<br>
                  build into<br>
                  some<br>
                  something. Just some<br>
                  something.<br>
                  <br>
                  And for the moment,<br>
                  that's enough.<br>
                  <br>
                  Enough to turn to the sun<br>
                  turn to the ocean<br>
                  the fumes,<br>
                  the pretend,<br>
                  <br>
                  and raise your hand<br>
                  from the blood.</p>

                <h2 class = "awards">broken window glass</h2>
                <p>broken window glass under my boot treads<br>
                  leather black against tinted glass green<br>
                  i think this break-in<br>
                  stole the snow<br><br>

                  they litter their sidewalks with cracked ink<br>
                  evidence of crime<br>
                  'gainst nature and time<br>
                  they hate it (the cold the snow)<br>
                  tell me to break<br>
                  my windows smash<br>
                  my mirrors<br>
                  toss the shards to sidewalk cures<br><br>

                  glasses down i don't wanna break the ice<br>
                  lips spread teeth out in the white<br>
                  incisors bite down<br>
                  can't you see i'm smiling bright?<br>
                  don't take my clothes at their black worth<br>
                  i'm enjoying all this sight<br>
                  throwing keys against the ice i'd rather<br>
                  lick the falling rice<br>
                  than smash my face in a clear glass<br>
                  window<br><br>

                  detritus of the burglary<br>
                  crunching shards against the heel<br>
                  of feet they'd cut in summertime<br><br>

                  maybe in a minute a month<br>
                  i'll break the frosted windows crack<br>
                  my blue glasses and<br>
                  scream and shatter and throw it all<br>
                  to the sidewalks show it all<br>
                  my magnificent theft of winter<br>
                  thought<br>
                  the breakin and breakout will be all<br>
                  that is left<br><br>

                  maybe in a second a semester<br>
                  i'll sit in my room and sprinkle broken glass<br>
                  on my toast and tea<br>
                  and cuddle the dead heaters heart at last<br><br>

                  but somehow i think<br>
                  i'd rather the joyride<br>
                  to the breakin<br>
                  i'd prefer the snow<br>
                  to the salt<br>
                  the impulse flow<br>
                  to the controlled stall<br><br>

                  so keep your broken glass to<br>
                  yourself your burgled cars<br>
                  to your own health<br>
                  i'll walk in the white<br><br>

                  i like the bite</p>
